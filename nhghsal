In SQL, id is the primary key column for this table.
Each row of this table contains information about the salary of an employee.
 

Find the nth highest salary from the Employee table. If there is no nth highest salary, return null.

CREATE FUNCTION getNthHighestSalary(N INT) RETURNS INT
BEGIN
DECLARE ANS INT;
SET ANS = N - 1;
  RETURN (
      # Write your MySQL query statement below.
      SELECT DISTINCT Salary
      FROM Employee
      ORDER BY Salary DESC
      LIMIT 1 OFFSET ANS
      
  );
END

/* Here, LIMIT returns the number of rows we need, offset indicates after how many rows. Ex: if we need 5 th highest sal, 4 will be offset so that 4 rows will be left.
